Can we differentiate a weed from a crop seedling?
The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment.

Although the issue of identifying weeds from plant seedlings may not seem concerning, it actually can be, as if weeds are left there with the other plants or misidentified to instead be a plant, in the long term, weeds can bring plants to not grow as much as they do consume a portion of their nutrients. This would largely impact agriculture in a negative aspect as plants will not grow to their fullest and there will be less of them, although it depends on the type of weed that is present there is no point in taking a chance. As depending on the type, weeds can cause crop yield loss, taint food and feed crops, can harbor problem insects and crop diseases, and much can also cause many other problems that would impact the harvest. Weeds typically sometimes look very green and identical to plants, which is why it is sometimes difficult to identify 100% accurately from a human perspective. It is estimated that weeds cost $2.5 billion a year in lost agricultural production within Australia which is a tremendous loss of money and agriculture. Weeds are indeed a growing issue within the agriculture industry.

In order to identify the different plant seedlings, and thus find what are the weeds, machine learning can greatly help the problem of classifying plants and weeds. As by creating a CNN model that can identify the images to place them in the correct category with a high accuracy rate, can ultimately change how weeds are negatively impacting the current state of agriculture.

I have obtained the dataset from the kaggle. Please find the link below.

### Data Description
We are provided with a training set and a test set of images of plant seedlings at various stages of grown. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo. The list of species is as follows:

- Black-grass
- Charlock
- Cleavers
- Common Chickweed
- Common wheat
- Fat Hen
- Loose Silky-bent
- Maize
- Scentless Mayweed
- Shepherds Purse
- Small-flowered Cranesbill
- Sugar beet

## Key Takeaways
- Artificial Intelligence can impact numerous industries and ways that are unimaginable and can impact the world such a positive way
- Using CNNâ€™s and actually implementing it within agriculture can lower costs and help save plants thus produce more food
