# Plant-Seedlings-Classification
Can we differentiate a weed from a crop seedling?
The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment.

From this project we aim to build a model which can effectively differentiate a weed from a crop seedling which can give better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment.
The dataset have been released by the Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark 3 years ago, which containing images of approximately 960 unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages.

I have obtained the dataset from the kaggle. Please find the link below.

### Data Description
We are provided with a training set and a test set of images of plant seedlings at various stages of grown. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 12 plant species. The goal of the project is to create a classifier capable of determining a plant's species from a photo. The list of species is as follows:

- Black-grass
- Charlock
- Cleavers
- Common Chickweed
- Common wheat
- Fat Hen
- Loose Silky-bent
- Maize
- Scentless Mayweed
- Shepherds Purse
- Small-flowered Cranesbill
- Sugar beet
